Real-World Application Essay

This workflow model could be extremely useful in a university course registration and advising system. In this scenario, the workflow would manage the interaction between students, academic advisors, and department administrators when handling course enrollment requests, prerequisite overrides, and schedule conflicts. Students would act similarly to the doctor role by submitting requests for course enrollment or prerequisite waivers. Academic advisors would function like lab assistants, reviewing these requests and either approving them or requesting additional information. Department administrators would take on the admin role, managing the overall system, creating new course offerings, and handling complex cases that require higher-level approval.

For example, imagine a student wants to enroll in an advanced programming course but lacks one prerequisite. The student would log into their work area and submit an override request with justification, such as relevant work experience or completion of equivalent coursework. This request would appear in their assigned advisor's work queue with a "Pending Review" status. The advisor could examine the student's transcript, review their justification, and either approve the override or deny it with feedback. Throughout this process, the student could track their request's status and view the advisor's decision and comments once completed.

To adapt this workflow model for a university context, I would modify the work request system to include an appeals process. Currently, once a request is marked complete, the workflow ends. However, in academic settings, students should have the ability to appeal decisions they disagree with. This modification would add a new status called "Under Appeal" and route the request to a department chair or dean for final review. This additional layer would ensure fairness while maintaining the efficient workflow structure that makes the original system effective.
