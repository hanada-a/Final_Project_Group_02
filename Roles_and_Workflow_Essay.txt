Roles and Workflow Essay

The Doctor role plays a crucial part in the workflow's functionality by initiating and tracking lab test requests. When a doctor logs into the system, they access their specialized work area that displays their personal work queue containing all their pending and completed requests. The doctor's primary responsibility is creating lab test work requests that get sent to the laboratory for processing. For example, imagine a doctor examining a patient who needs blood work. The doctor uses the "Request Lab Test" panel to create a new work request with details about the required test. Once submitted, this request appears in the lab assistant's work queue with a status of "Sent." The doctor can then monitor this request's progress through their interface. As the lab assistant processes and completes the test, the status updates to "Complete," and the doctor can view the results directly in their work area. This role contributes to workflow functionality by serving as the starting point for requests and the endpoint for receiving results, creating a complete communication loop between medical professionals. Without the doctor role, there would be no mechanism to initiate the testing process that drives the entire workflow system.
